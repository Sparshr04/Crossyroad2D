This is just a Turtle Game with all the basic functionalities and the main goal was to replicate the gamous game called 'The Crossy Road'

All I did was, I used the turtle library to simulate the chicken that crosses the road and to create the random cars on the road.

The functionalities that are used are all related to the turtle library

There is no need to download any library coz turtle in included with Python installations.
